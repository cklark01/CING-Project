The two levels of PPI networks were aligned and compared to identify the PPI subnetwork that exists in both levels. The proteins regulated at both translation and posttranslation levels (bi-level) and their PPI networking are named as “bi-level temperature-responsive subnetwork” (Fig. 3.5) due to the hypothesis that proteins regulated at both translational and posttranslational levels and their associated proteins should be important components of the cells to respond to the temperature stresses. The bi-level–regulated proteins are shown in Table 3.2.

However, these methods are labor intensive and costly, can produce false positives and false negatives, and do not necessarily reveal the functional relevance of the detected interactions. Thus, even with these experimental data available (as structural network templates), data-driven network reconstruction is still necessary to complement the results and to extract functionally relevant models that predict relevant biological phenotypes."

The development of algorithms to address this challenging task has been at the heart of the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Method (DREAM) challenges (http://dreamchallenges.org).233 In these challenges, the participants were asked to reconstruct a genome-scale regulatory network from a large collection of microarray data sets to predict a PPI network of 47 proteins and predict the genes for transcription factor binding (DREAM2); infer a signaling network from flow cytometry data (DREAM 3); infer simulated gene regulation networks and predict gene expression measurements (DREAM 4); and infer simulated and in vivo gene regulation networks (DREAM5). More recently, the participants were asked to predict outcomes of perturbations in systems biology models after being given the complete and incomplete structures of the model for a gene regulatory network (DREAM7).233–237"
